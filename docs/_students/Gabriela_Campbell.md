# About Me

Hi! I'm Gabriela Campbell, a 4th year undergraduate at Butler University's college of Liberal Arts and Sciences. I'm passionate about computational mathematics, machine learning, and algorithm analysis. Some of my research interests are in physical chemistry, specifically in modelling electron transmissions in chains of atoms.

### ðŸ“Œ Automating the Fragmentation of Proteins

**Description**: Currently, preferred energy models for predicting enzymatic reactions are very expensive. We can break up the energy calculations of proteins, ligands, and their environment into smaller, more manageable calculations to approximate the reaction. However, there are many ways to break these calculations up, resulting in varying accuracy. This project aims to develop an automated solution to fragmenting proteins that minimizes the error in the approximation.
**Tech Stack**: Python, GitHub, SQLite
