# About Me

Hi! I'm Gabriela Campbell, a 4th year undergrad at Butler University's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. I'm majoring in pure mathematics with a minor in computer science, and am passionate about computational mathematics, machine learning, and algorithm analysis. Some of my research interests are in representations of Lie Algebras, as well as physical chemistry, specifically in modelling electron transmissions in chains of atoms.

## ðŸ“š Projects or SIMCODES Contributions

### ðŸ“Œ Automating the Fragmentation of Proteins

**Description**: I'll be working with my mentors on Machine Learning or AI approaches to automating the fragmentation of proteins. The goal is to reduce the cost of energy calculations by finding out the best way to break up the calculation, then measuring how accurate the final energy approximation is to experimental results.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, GitHub, SQLite
