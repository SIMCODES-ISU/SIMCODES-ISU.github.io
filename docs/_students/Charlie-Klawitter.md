### ðŸ“Œ Machine Learning-Enhanced Computational Modeling of Metal-Protein Interactions 

**Description**: The goal of this project was to enhance the modeling of metal-protein interactions with accuracy and efficiency. Data was generated using the Effective Fragment Potential (EFP) method. Using Python scripts, the data was extracted to be used as input data for the machine learning model. The model chosen was a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The majority of the work of this project consisted of programming the neural network model with a focus on refining the parameters. In the end, the DNN was very successful in predicting the key energies used to model metal-protein interactions.   

**Tech Stack**: Python, GitHub, SQLite, GAMESS

## âš   Advice for Future Students

My biggest piece of advice for future SIMCODES REU Students is to take advantage of the resources that ISU has to offer. Use your downtime to connect and network with other students and professors on campus. Use the campus library for access to a wide range of textbooks and research papers. Enjoy the amazing food at the dining hall and make an effort to use the ISU Rec Services. Overall, just enjoy yourself in Ames and make the most of this unique experience.
