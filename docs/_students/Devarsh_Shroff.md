## ðŸ“š Projects or SIMCODES Contributions

### ðŸ“Œ Automating the Fragmentation of proteins

**Description**: This project aims to accelerate energy calculations for proteins by automating fragmentation using graph-based machine learning techniques.
 We developed a pipeline that uses clustering algorithms (Spectral Clustering, Louvain Method) on molecular graphs to generate chemically accurate fragments,
 applying hydrogen capping, and runs xTB(energy calculations) calculations in parallel.  We worked on manual validation of capping techniques, hyper-parameter
 tuning across 2,500+ peptides helped optimize fragmentation accuracy. Chemically-aware edge weighting further improved results, significantly reducing error.
 Our goal is to further reduce the energy difference and scale the program for proteins.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, Bash, CLI, xTB, Conda, scikit-learn,NetworkX, etc.

## Advice for Future Students

Research experience is very different from classroom learning; it's hands-on, exploratory, and full of unknowns. Be curious and proactive, think about different
 ways to approach the problem and donâ€™t hesitate to dig into the details. Mentors are there to guide you and help you see the bigger picture, but youâ€™ll also have
 the freedom to explore your own solutions. Most importantly, enjoy the experience, connect with others, ask questions, and make the most of your time at Ames!
