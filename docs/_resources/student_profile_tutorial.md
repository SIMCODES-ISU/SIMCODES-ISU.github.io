# 🧑‍🎓 How to create your SIMCODES Student Profile (With Picture and Bio)

Welcome to SIMCODES! This guide will help you create your personal student
profile that will be listed on the [Students Page](/students/). Your profile
will include:

- ✅ Your name and a short introduction
- ✅ A clear profile photo
- ✅ A dedicated profile page linked from the main list

---

## 📁 Step 1: Prepare Your Profile Picture

1. Save a photo of yourself with a square aspect ratio.
2. Resize it to **around 300x300px** (optional).
3. Name the file like `yourname.png` (e.g., `student.png`)
4. Place it inside the folder:  
   `/_students/images/`

---

## 📝 ✍️ Step 2: Create Your Profile File and fill the details

Inside the project folder, go to `_students/` and create a new Markdown file
named like this:

```
_students/your-name.md
```

You can also copy the sampleStudent.md file and rename it and make your
changes in it

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Preview Your Profile (Locally)

Since we are running the site locally with Jekyll:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit:

```
http://localhost:4000/students/
```

You’ll see your photo and name listed. Click on it to go to your full profile!

## 🧪 Step 4: Push your changes to SIMCODES Github repo and create a PR

Refer - [Github Basics](https://simcodes-isu.github.io/student-resources/) for
the Github setup and commands

## ✅ Profile Guidelines

- Keep your intro short (2–4 sentences).
- Use a clear profile photo and banner image.
- If you're stuck, look at an example file: `/_students/sample_student.md`
