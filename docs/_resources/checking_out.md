Unfortunately SIMCODES is only a 10 week program and you will have to leave us.
This page collects notes, and points to be aware of, pertaining to what 
SIMCODES, AMES, ISU, and ISU housing need from you in order to check you out.

# SIMCODES Checkout Procedure

- You will receive a link to the exit survey during your last week. This survey
  will parallel the survey you took when you started the program. We are
  constantly striving to make SIMCODES better, so please use this opportunity
  to anonymously tell us what you liked best as well as any ways we can improve.
  You are always welcome to submit non-anonymous feedback via Slack or email as
  well! 
- Check your code/data into the SIMCODES GitHub organization. Make sure your 
  repository is documented (what the goal was, what you did, how the repository
  is structured, what still needs to be done, any standards/conventions used, 
  etc.).
- Update your website profile. In particular:

  - Ensure each section is tailored to you and is NOT the stub provided by the 
    template.
  - Please make sure the "Projects or SIMCODES Contributions" section lists the 
    project(s) you worked on, a one-paragraph description of what you did for 
    the project and link(s) to the corresponding repository(s).
  - Please check off any goals you feel you accomplished.
  - (Optional) add a new Section "Advice for Future Students" and provide any 
    advice/tips you want to share with the next cohort.

# AMES Checkout Procedure

- You should receive an email from amesprod@servicenowservices.com about a week
  in advance of your departure date.
- If you have any of the following, you will need to return them to the SIMCODES
  PI or Co-PI:

  - Physical keys to AMES lab spaces.
  - Physical lab notebooks.
  - Ames National Laboratory ID badges.

# ISU Housing Checkout Procedures

- When leaving your apartment, clean the space and kitchens well. The custodial 
  team will be cleaning each apartment after you leave to prepare for the 
  incoming ISU students in that apartment. Any assistance they can get from you 
  in the form of a cleaner apartment will be greatly appreciated!
- If you have linens, please place your pillow and all other linens separately 
  on your bed. Do not place the pillow in the same pile as your linens.
- Double check all your wardrobes, cabinets, drawers, and other storages spaces 
  to make sure you arenâ€™t leaving anything behind!
- Return your keypacket to the key-drop-box located in the Freddy Court central 
  office building (Hawthorne). This box is to the left of the Freddy Court desk 
  on a table.

  - Double check that your room key, apartment key, and building keycard are 
    inside before returning them!
  - Once you drop your keys in the box, send a short email to 
    conference@iastate.edu with your name and apartment and room number found on
    the bottom of your keypacket (Example: John Smith, 5234-2) along with any 
    other information you may want ISU housing to know about the apartment you 
    are vacating.

- Please also return the meal cards.
