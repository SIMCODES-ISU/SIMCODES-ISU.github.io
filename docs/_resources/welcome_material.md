This page collects information that is relevant to students that were just
accepted into the SIMCODES program. For your convenience there is a task-list
at the bottom which summarizes what you are expected to do.

# Specific Information Your Welcome Email Should Include

- Link to join the Slack space.
- What dorm/apartment you will be staying in.
- Move-in/Move-out dates.
- Link to a pre-survey.
- Deadlines for tasks.

# Communication and Updates

The SIMCODES organization relies on three methods of communication:

- Email for initial contact and important announcements.
  - Emails will usually come from the PI and/or Co-PI.
- Slack for day-to-day communication.
  - Similar to Microsoft Teams or other communication platforms.
  - Preferred because of its price tag (i.e., free) and cross-platform nature.
- GitHub for discussions related to source code.
  - All projects will involve developing software deployed on GitHub.
  - GitHub has a number of built-in features that make it easier to collaborate
    on code. We will leverage a number of these features.

Your welcome email will contain a link to join the Slack space. You will need to
send the PI or Co-PI your GitHub username in order to be added to the SIMCODES
GitHub organization. In order to ensure you do not miss announcements you are
strongly encouraged to join Slack and GitHub as soon as possible.

# Travel Arrangements

The closest commercial airport to Ames, IA is the 
[Des Moines Airport (DSM)](https://www.flydsm.com). It is about a 40-minute 
taxi, Uber, or Lyft ride from DSM to ISU. If you opt to fly to Ames we will
request that you send us your preferred itinerary as soon as possible and we
will have ISU book your flights. We will also try to have ISU arrange 
transportation from DSM to ISU. Please do NOT book flights yourself, unless
the PI or Co-PI have authorized it.

For a driving perspective, Ames is about 200 miles from Minneapolis, MN and 
Lincoln, NE and 350 miles from Chicago, IL and  St. Louis, MO. SIMCODES is 
willing to reimburse mileage at the ISU rate (up to the cost of an airline 
ticket). ISU's mileage rate changes from year-to-year, but is typically around
$0.35/mile. Current rate can be found 
[here](https://www.controller.iastate.edu/travel-expenses-allowed). If you are
driving you must send the PI or Co-PI your license plate number and the state it
was issued in.

Regardless of whether you fly or drive, SIMCODES is willing to cover any
REASONABLE travel expenses you encounter (e.g., your meals or snacks). For us
to do this you must save receipts.

# Initial Assignments

Between receiving your welcome email and the time you get to Ames, we would
like you to take some time to complete some initial tasks detailed below.

## Rank Research Projects

Over the next week, please read over the 
[SIMCODES](https://simcodes-isu.github.io/), paying particular attention to the 
[Projects](https://simcodes-isu.github.io/projects/) and 
[Mentors](https://simcodes-isu.github.io/mentors/) sections. Each project
includes a number of sub-projects, you will be working on one sub-project during
your stay. Your task is to rank the top-three *sub*-projects you want to work
on.

Sub-Projects are identified with the heading “What You’ll Do”. Please send, via
Slack or email, your preferences.

## Student Profile

Another major component of SIMCODES will be using GitHub. To that end, we ask 
that you sign up for GitHub, send your profile name to Ryan, and get familiar
with the basics of GitHub. To demonstrate that you’ve nailed the basics, we 
will ask you to create a profile for the SIMCODES page (similar to the profiles 
for each mentor).  If you do not feel comfortable with having a profile page on 
the SIMCODES site, you do not have to do this; we would instead ask you to 
propose some other change to the website (e.g., find a typo or sentence that 
could be written better).

We note that GitHub will allow you to directly upload files through the website,
as opposed to using Git directly. Git will be covered during the bootcamp. If
you are not familiar with Git, feel free to directly upload files to GitHub in
order to complete this task.

## Initial Readings

We strongly encourage you to consider perusing the “Resources” page of the 
SIMCODES website. In particular, if you are new to GitHub, Linux, and Python, 
read through https://simcodes-isu.github.io/student-resources/. If you get stuck
or have questions, Slack is again a great place to ask. Ideally, when the 
bootcamp starts, every student will be able to open a Linux terminal, write a 
Python script that prints “Hello SIMCODES!” and run said script.
