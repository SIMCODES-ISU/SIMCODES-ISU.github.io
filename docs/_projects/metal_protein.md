# Background

Metals are essential to biological processes, ranging from enzyme catalysis to
DNA binding. However, accurately modeling their interactions with proteins
and solvents remains a major challenge in computational chemistry. Classical
methods often fail to capture the complexity of metal-ion binding, limiting
progress in drug discovery and bioengineering. In this project, you will help
validate and refine a quantum mechanical (QM) computational approach that
combines quantum chemistry, fragmentation methods, and machine learning
(ML) to model metal-protein interactions with accuracy and efficiency

# Key Objectives

- Validate a fragmentation-based computational strategy for modeling
  metal-protein interactions.
- Integrate machine learning to enhance predictions of metal binding in
  biological systems.
- Create a scalable workflow for future large-scale screening of metal-
  targeting therapeutics

# What You’ll Do

- **Learn advanced tools** Gain hands-on experience with quantum
  chemistry software (GAMESS), the Effective Fragment Potential (EFP)
  method, and coding/scripting for high-throughput simulations.
- **Build ML models**Train and refine ML algorithms to predict metal-ion
  binding strengths using existing and newly generated datasets.
- **Generate & analyze data** Run computational experiments on metal-
  residue complexes and solvated metal ions, then curate and interpret
  results to improve model accuracy.
- **Develop workflows**Design automated pipelines for data generation,
  job submission, and energy decomposition analysis

# Skills You’ll Gain

- Quantum chemical calculations (EFP, GAMESS)
- Python/bash scripting for workflow automation
- Machine learning model development (training, validation, refinement)
- Data analysis and visualization for biomolecular systems
