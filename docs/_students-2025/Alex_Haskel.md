# About Me

Hi! I'm Alex Haskel, currently a third-year undergraduate student at Hunter 
College, in New York City. Iâ€™m passionate about computer science, physics, 
philosophy, and math. In particular, I am interested in AI, ML, scientific 
computing, algorithms, and computer vision.

## ðŸ›  Skills & Technologies

- Programming Languages: Python, C++, Mathematica
- Tools: Git, VS Code
- OS: Linux, Windows
- Others: Markdown, LaTeX

## ðŸ“š Projects or SIMCODES Contributions

### ðŸ“Œ Machine Learning-Enhanced Computational Modeling of Metal-Protein Interactions

**Description**: My work was to extract and clean data, and to analyze it using 
symbolic regession techniques and neural networks in order to improve quantum 
chemistry predictions.

In particular, our project consisted in trying to improve the accuracy of 
damping functions used within the Effective Fragment Potential (EFP) method, a 
computational approach designed to describe intermolecular interactions. I was 
responsible for extracting relevant data, putting it into formats suitable for 
machine learning, designing a symbolic regression pipeline using PySR, and 
creating a variety of neural networks to deal with the data using PyTorch.

**Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, PySR, Scikit-Learn
