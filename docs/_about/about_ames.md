# Getting Around Ames

The city of Ames relies on [CyRide](https://www.cyride.com/) for public 
transportation. You’ll find that the majority of people on the CyRide busses 
are ISU students or visiting students like yourselves. CyRide’s routes have 
excellent coverage of the ISU campus and decent coverage of places where you 
may want to shop for supplies, e.g., Target, Walmart, Hy-Vee, and Fairway (the 
latter two are our grocery stores).  

Generally, speaking most people either take CyRide or drive around Ames. It is
hoped that cohort members that drive to Ames will be willing to provide rides to
cohort members that fly. However, if you find yourself unable to find a ride,
consider reaching out to other members of your mentor's group. 

# Extracurricular Activities

We know that moving to a new city for a summer program is intimidating. To that
end, the SIMCODES team will try to host five or so extracurricular get 
togethers throughout the summer.

Examples include:

- Pizza and board game night.
- Fireworks around the July 4.
