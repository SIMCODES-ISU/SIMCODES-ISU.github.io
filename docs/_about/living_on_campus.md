You will be expected to live on ISU's campus as part of SIMCODES. This page
collects information regarding what you can expect during the ten weeks.

# Living Arrangements

SIMCODES will pay for you to live in either a University owned apartment or a 
dorm (availability varies from year to year). ISU is fairly strict on the 
move-in and move-out dates so that it will in general not be possible to 
move-in early or move-out late; however, late move-in and early move-out can be 
arranged. Please discuss late move-in/early move-out with the PI and Co-PI as 
soon as possible to ensure it will work.

In most cases you will share the apartment with one or more other cohort 
members. If you have roommate preferences please let the PI or Co-PI know. The
introductions channel on Slack is a great way to get to know other cohort
members and see if there are any mutual interests. If there are no preferences
for roommates the PI and Co-PI will assign roommates at their discretion.

SIMCODES will arrange for a meal plan. The meal plan can be used at any ISU
Dining [participant](https://www.dining.iastate.edu/hours-menus/). Dining
locations are NOT open 24/7 so you will be expected to supplement the meal
plan with "at-home" cooking.

# Working Arrangements

Who your mentor is will determine where your office is. Chemistry mentors will 
most likely provide you with office space in 
[Ames Lab](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CZfKRCyXdTYzKz3g8) or the buildings near it. 
Computer science is not too much further away in 
[Atanasoff Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iHH4WR7VatxncoZX8). All locations are 
within walking distance of university housing, and near CyRide stops.

# What We Will Provide

To make your stay easier, SIMCODES will lend you some living essentials 
including:

- TBD

If you want something more fancy like a sous vide or cheese board you'll have
to bring that. Ames has a number of second hand stores if you forget something.

# Things to Bring

- Laptop. SIMCODES is focused on computational chemistry, computer science,
  AI/ML, and software development. Having access to a computer for the duration
  of the summer is therefore critical. Please notify the PI or Co-PI immediately
  if you do not have a laptop.
  - You laptop does not need to be state-of-the art. Most laptops made within
    the last decade will suffice.
  - As part of SIMCODES you will get access to Nova, ISU's computing cluster.
    Nova can be used for computationally demanding tasks.
- Real ID. As part of SIMCODES you will be have the opportunity to be a 
  contributor to Ames National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy's
  Laboratory system. To onboard you, you must provide a Real ID. 
  - See [here](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification) for
    alternative forms of identification.
- Charging cables.
- Day-to-day clothes. Laundry is available.
- Personnel items.
- One nicer outfit (e.g., button-down shirt, slacks, dress, or skirt). Many
  students prefer to dress up a bit for the end of term symposium.
- Athletic clothes if you plan on playing sports (plenty of fields within 
  walking distances) or going to the gym.
- Swimsuit if you want to swim (Ames has a water park within walking distance).
- Alternative shoes (lots of hiking opportunities).
- Umbrella and/or raincoat.

We will arrange a small up front direct deposit which can be used to buy missing
supplies when you get here. We will arrange for graduate students in our group
to help provide rides on move-in day.
